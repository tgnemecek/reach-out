# Reach Out

Reach Out is a game about reversing expectations. It is - by rough definitions - an Arcade Shooter, but you are actually the bad guy who's trying for the first time to make friends. Luck is not on your side, however, as your ship's main gun broke and won't stop shooting. Avoid at all costs shooting incoming ships and try connecting with them, but things will surely get harder as your new friends won't stop firing as well.
